# GTAsus-windows
A simple batch script that uses pssuspend64 to kick all users from a GTA lobby.

Due to the Sysinternals license agreement, I cannot provide pssuspend64. You must download it from https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/.

Simply get `pssuspend64.exe` and put it in the same folder as the batch script.
